= Description
The net-proto package provides a way to get protocol information.

= Installation
gem install net-proto

= Synopsis
require 'net/proto'

Net::Proto.getprotobyname('tcp') # => 6
Net::Proto.getprotobynumber(0)   # => 'ip'

Net::Proto.getprotoent{ |entry| p entry }

= Notes
This library is a wrapper for the getprotobyname(), getprotobynumber() and
the getprotoent() functions.

The net-proto package uses reentrant code for sunos and linux. Otherwise, the
generic form of the functions are used (which may be reentrant by default
anway - check the man pages on your platform).

The Proto.getprotoent method is not supported on MS Windows because the
underlying function isn't supported by the MS Windows API.

= Why should I use this?
Ruby has a predefined set of constants in socket.c in the general form of
IPPROTO_XXX, Y.  However, using constants in this fashion can be unreliable
because it's easy to define your own protocols (I set 'echo' to 7, for
example), or to modify/delete entries in /etc/protocols.

= Further Documentation
See the 'netproto.txt' file under the 'doc' directory for more details.  There
is also an example under the 'examples' directory.
