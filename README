== Description
The net-proto package provides a way to get protocol information.

This is really just a wrapper for the getprotobyname(), getprotobynumber() and
the getprotoent() functions.

== Prerequisites
Ruby 1.8.0 or later.

== Installation
rake test (optional)
rake install (non-gem) OR rake install_gem (gem)

== Notes
The net-proto package uses reentrant code for sunos and linux. Otherwise, the
generic form of the functions are used (which may be reentrant by default
anway - check the man pages on your platform).

The Proto.getprotoent method is not supported on MS Windows because the
underlying function isn't supported by the MS Windows API.

== Why should I use this?
Ruby has a predefined set of constants in socket.c in the general form of
IPPROTO_XXX, Y.  However, using constants in this fashion can be unreliable
because it's easy to define your own protocols (I set 'echo' to 7, for
example), or to modify/delete entries in /etc/protocols.

== Further Documentation
See the 'netproto.txt' file under the 'doc' directory for more details.  There
is also an example under the 'examples' directory.
