== Description
The net-proto package provides a way to get protocol information.

This is really just a wrapper for the getprotobyname(), getprotobynumber() and
the getprotoent() functions.

== Installation
gem install net-proto

== Prerequisites
ffi 0.6.0 or later on unix systems.

== Synopsis
require 'net/proto'

# Using generic method
Net::Proto.get_protocol(1)      # => 'icmp'
Net::Proto.get_protocol('icmp') # => 1

# Using type specific methods
Net::Proto.getprotobynumber(6)   # => 'tcp'
Net::Proto.getprotobyname('tcp') # => 6

# Iterating over all protocols
Net::Proto.getprotoent do |ent|
  p ent
end

== MS Windows
The Proto.getprotoent method is not supported on MS Windows because the
underlying function isn't supported by the MS Windows API.

== Why should I use this?
Ruby has a predefined set of constants in socket.c in the general form of
IPPROTO_XXX, Y.  However, using constants in this fashion can be unreliable
because it's easy to define your own protocols (I set 'echo' to 7, for
example), or to modify/delete entries in /etc/protocols.

== Further Documentation
See the 'netproto.txt' file under the 'doc' directory for more details.  There
is also an example under the 'examples' directory.
