  a license and an updated description.

* It is now explicitly illegal to call Net::Proto.new.
* Some minor modifications to extconf.rb in terms of how and where the
  the source is built in order to be potentially more friendly to Rubygems.

  StringValuePtr() function.  That means that, as of this release, this
  package requires Ruby 1.8.0 or later.
* Minor documentation corrections.

== 0.2.2 - 10-Apr-2004
* No longer returns an Array in block form.  Only the non-block form returns
  an array.  The block form returns nil.
